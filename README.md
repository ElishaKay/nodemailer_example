The easiest way to get started with NPM's NodeMailer Package

```bash
# Install NPM dependencies
npm install

Copy the keys.example.js content into a new file titled "key.js", and input your Mail Credentials

node send_email.js
```

Note: You can test your email template within the root directory, by double-clicking 'responsive.html'. When your template is ready, simply copy-paste the html and css into the file at './js/responsive_email.js'

This is the content that will be pulled by Nodemailer when you run ```node send_email.js```

Another note: Images should be hosted online if you want them to appear cleanly in your emails.
